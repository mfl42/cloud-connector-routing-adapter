# Roadmap

## Objective

Support complex network configurations — multiple VRFs, VLAN subinterfaces,
BGP peers, policy routes, static routes — without throughput bottlenecks,
silent misconfiguration, or incomplete convergence on deletion.

## Completed

### Batch apply — VyOS API

**Problem:** each `set` command was sent as a separate HTTPS request to the
VyOS API. For a configuration involving 8 VRFs and VLAN subinterfaces, this
produced 100 or more sequential HTTP roundtrips, causing a throughput
bottleneck proportional to configuration complexity.

**Fix:** the adapter now sends the full batch of `set`/`delete` operations in
a single `/configure-list` call. The previous sequential path is kept as a
fallback for older VyOS targets that do not expose `/configure-list`.

Impact: N sequential roundtrips → 1 atomic transaction, regardless of the
number of VRFs, routes, or peers in the configuration.

---

### VLAN subinterface mapping

**Problem:** interface names in the form `eth0.100` were passed as-is to VyOS
`set` commands. VyOS does not accept dot-notation in that position — VLAN
subinterfaces are configured through the `vif` hierarchy
(`set interfaces ethernet eth0 vif 100 ...`). The resulting commands were
silently accepted by VyOS but produced no actual configuration.

**Fix:** the translator detects the `base.vlan-id` pattern and generates the
correct `vif` hierarchy for both VRF attachment and interface address
assignment. The fix covers `NodeNetworkConfig` (VRF attachment) and
`NodeNetplanConfig` (address assignment).

---

### Delete convergence — teardown on document removal

**Problem:** when a `NodeNetworkConfig` or `NodeNetplanConfig` was deleted from
Kubernetes, the adapter marked it as a local tombstone but sent no `delete`
commands to VyOS. The routing configuration remained in place on the target.

**Fix:** the controller now calls `teardown_documents` immediately after
marking a document as deleted. Teardown generates coarse-grained VyOS deletes:
one `delete vrf name 'X'` covers the entire VRF block (table, static routes,
BGP), and separate deletes handle policy route maps and interface VRF
attachments. Netplan-sourced configuration (addresses, nameservers, static
routes) is removed with fine-grained targeted deletes.

---

### Delete convergence — partial modification diff

**Problem:** when a document was modified to remove a VRF, a static route, or a
BGP peer, only the new desired `set` commands were sent. The removed items were
never deleted from VyOS.

**Fix:** on each apply, the adapter now computes the diff between the previously
applied command set and the new desired command set. Commands that were applied
before but are absent from the new state generate `delete` operations, prepended
before the new `set` batch. For BGP peers, all leaf-level removes for a given
neighbor are collapsed into a single `delete ... bgp neighbor 'addr'` to avoid
leaving VyOS in a partially configured state during commit.

---

### Applied command tracking

**Problem:** the local state file tracked revision digests but not the commands
themselves, making it impossible to compute a precise diff on modification or
reconstruct teardown commands on deletion.

**Fix:** `DocumentState` now persists `applied_commands` — the exact list of
`set` commands sent during the last successful apply. This field drives both
the diff-based partial delete and the full teardown path.

---

### Kubernetes watch — concurrent resource kinds

**Problem:** when watching multiple CRD kinds (NodeNetworkConfig and
NodeNetplanConfig), the adapter polled them sequentially and split the timeout
budget between them. With N kinds, each watch received only 1/N of the
available time before the loop moved on, increasing the lag between a change in
Kubernetes and the next reconcile cycle.

**Fix:** `watch_for_change` now launches one watcher thread per resource kind
and runs them concurrently via `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Each watcher receives the
full timeout. The single-kind path avoids thread overhead entirely.

---

### Idempotent error tolerance — sequential fallback

**Problem:** when the `/configure-list` batch endpoint was unavailable and the
adapter fell back to sequential single-command calls, a VyOS response of
`{"success": false, "error": "... already exists"}` caused the entire
operation to be reported as failed. This could block state progression on
re-apply of a partially applied configuration.

**Fix:** the sequential fallback now recognises "already exists" and
"is already defined" responses as idempotent successes. The overall operation
succeeds as long as every command either applied or was already present.

---

### File polling — mtime guard

**Problem:** `FileDocumentSource.wait_for_update` reloaded and reparsed the
source file on every poll interval, regardless of whether the file had changed.

**Fix:** the poll loop now reads `os.stat().st_mtime` before attempting a
reload. If the timestamp is unchanged, the poll returns immediately without
I/O or parsing.

---

### Translator lifecycle

**Problem:** `VyosTranslator` was instantiated on every controller iteration
inside the reconcile loop, allocating a new object with each pass even though
the translator is stateless.

**Fix:** `run_controller` instantiates `VyosTranslator` once at startup and
passes the same instance to every reconcile call.

---

## Known Bugs

Bugs identified by static analysis of the current codebase. Grouped by
severity: P0 (crash or guaranteed state corruption), P1 (silent incorrect
behaviour), P2 (unprotected edge case), P3 (design fragility).

---

### P0 — Fixed

#### ~~translator.py — IndexError on empty port list~~ (false positive)

On analysis the access `traffic.source_ports[0]` is already guarded by
`if traffic.source_ports:` on the preceding line. No fix required.

#### k8s_documents.py — uncaught JSONDecodeError in watch loop ✓

`json.loads(line)` in `_watch_resource` now wraps the parse in a
try/except JSONDecodeError. Malformed lines are skipped; the watch continues.

#### state.py — mkdir not called for relative subdirectory paths ✓

The condition `if state_path.parent != Path(".")` was removed. `mkdir()` is
now called unconditionally with `exist_ok=True`, which is a no-op when the
directory already exists and correctly handles all path forms including
relative subdirectory paths.

#### k8s_status.py — TLS credential tempfiles never deleted ✓

`_materialize_temp_file()` now appends each created path to a module-level
list. An `atexit` handler calls `os.unlink()` on all tracked paths at process
exit. Files that were already removed are silently ignored.

#### reconcile.py — applied state updated on partial apply failure ✓

The apply section now reads `vyos_response.get("success", True)` before
updating state. On failure: `last_result` is set to `"apply-failed"`,
`last_error` records the VyOS error message, and `applied_revision`,
`applied_digest`, and `applied_commands` are left unchanged. The document
action in the run result is set to `"apply-failed"` so callers can distinguish
a failed apply from a pending-apply or no-op.

---

### P1 — Fixed

#### ~~translator.py — policy route emitted without protocol filter on unknown protocol~~ ✓

When all protocols in `trafficMatch.protocols` are unrecognised, the rule is
now skipped entirely. Previously the rule was emitted without a protocol
clause, matching all traffic on the interface.

#### ~~translator.py — ebgp-multihop 0 sent to VyOS~~ ✓

`ebgp-multihop` is now only emitted when the value is greater than zero.
A value of `0` (disabled) is silently skipped.

#### ~~translator.py — policy-route IPv4 assumed when no valid prefix found~~ ✓

`_policy_address_family()` now returns `None` (skip rule) when prefixes are
provided but all are invalid. The IPv4 default is only used when no prefixes
are specified at all.

#### ~~translator.py — incorrect VyOS interface type for VLAN on non-ethernet base~~ ✓

`_netplan_interface_path()` (replacing `_netplan_address_command()`) now uses
`_infer_interface_type()` with an `"ethernet"` fallback only, and applies the
same logic for both VLAN sub-interfaces and plain interfaces. All address,
MTU, DHCP, and route commands derive their type from the same helper.

#### ~~translator.py — spurious "no table" warning for interface-only VRFs~~ ✓

The warning is now scoped to VRFs that have static routes, BGP peers, or
policy routes — the cases where the routing table is actually required.

#### ~~controller.py — raw dict comparison causes false-positive reconcile triggers~~ ✓

Document change detection now uses `json.dumps(sort_keys=True)` for
comparison, making it insensitive to key ordering differences.

#### ~~controller.py — teardown exception aborts the reconcile cycle~~ ✓

`teardown_documents()` is now wrapped in a try/except. Teardown failures are
logged to stderr but do not abort the reconcile iteration.

#### ~~state.py — corrupted state file raises unhandled exception~~ ✓

`ReconcileState.load()` now catches `json.JSONDecodeError` and returns an
empty state, allowing the adapter to start cleanly after a crash.

#### ~~state.py — non-numeric field value in state file raises ValueError~~ ✓

`_int_or_none()` now catches `ValueError` and `TypeError`, returning `None`
for any non-numeric value instead of crashing.

#### ~~status.py — transition_time changes on every call when timestamps are absent~~ ✓

`build_status_report()` now accepts an optional `now` parameter and threads a
single timestamp through all `_build_document_status()` calls. Successive
calls on the same unchanged state produce identical output.

#### reconcile.py — BGP delete consolidation regex misses quoted special characters

The regex `r"^set (vrf name '[^']+' protocols bgp neighbor '[^']+')(?:\s|$)"`
does not handle VRF names or neighbor addresses that contain an escaped single
quote. Such commands are not consolidated and instead generate individual leaf
deletes, which may leave VyOS with a partially configured neighbor after commit.

---

### P2 — Fixed

#### ~~translator.py — loopback inferred but never emitted~~ ✓

`"loopback"` has been removed from `_infer_interface_type()`. Interfaces
starting with `lo` now produce a clean "unknown interface family" unsupported
marker rather than the misleading "inferred as loopback" message.

#### ~~models.py — empty VRF name accepted~~ ✓

`VrfSpec.from_dict()` now raises `ValueError` immediately when `name` is empty
or whitespace-only, making the models layer the primary rejection point.

#### ~~vyos_api.py — idempotent error detection is version-dependent~~ ✓

`_is_idempotent_response()` now also matches `"already set"` and
`"is already present"` to cover additional VyOS version variants.

#### ~~vyos_api.py — show_config() is dead code~~ ✓

`VyosApiClient.show_config()` has been removed.

#### ~~k8s_documents.py — futures_wait timeout is double-counted~~ ✓

The outer `futures_wait` timeout is now `full_timeout + self.timeout`,
removing the redundant `+5` constant.

#### ~~k8s_documents.py — only the first watch event per cycle is processed~~ ✓

`_watch_resource()` now collects all events from the stream and returns a
`list[WatchEvent]`. After the first change event, a 150 ms drain timer closes
the stream so that events arriving in rapid succession are all captured in one
cycle without blocking for the full `timeoutSeconds`. Callers updated to use
`extend` instead of a single-event append.

#### ~~k8s_status.py — token file read without error handling~~ ✓

The `tokenFile` read is now wrapped in a try/except that surfaces a clear
`RuntimeError` instead of letting an `OSError` propagate unexpectedly.

#### ~~controller.py — local import inside conditional block~~ ✓

`write_status_report` is now imported at module level alongside the other
`status` imports.

---

### P3 — Fixed

#### ~~models.py / translator.py — validation boundary is split across two layers~~ ✓

`VrfSpec.from_dict()` now raises `ValueError` immediately for an empty VRF
name, making the models layer the primary rejection point for that case.
Remaining translator-side guards are kept as a defence-in-depth layer for
objects constructed directly (not via `from_dict`).

#### ~~models.py — protocol normalisation coupled to translator internals~~ ✓

`translator.py` now exposes `_SUPPORTED_PROTOCOLS` as a module-level
`frozenset` with an explicit comment documenting the coupling to the
`models.py` normalisation step. A cross-reference comment in `models.py`
points back to `_SUPPORTED_PROTOCOLS`, making the contract visible without
reading both files in full.

#### ~~k8s_resources.py — CRD plural names are hardcoded~~ ✓

`SUPPORTED_CUSTOM_RESOURCES` is now a mutable list and `register_resource()`
is exposed as a public function. Callers can add or replace a CRD kind at
runtime without modifying `k8s_resources.py`.

---

## Planned

Items are ordered by **priority × complexity** — highest priority and lowest
complexity first. Each entry carries a complexity label (trivial / low /
medium / high / very high) and a priority label (high / medium / low).

---

### 1 — Design decisions (trivial / high priority)

These items have no VyOS equivalent or are intentionally out of scope. They
are closed as design decisions, not implementation gaps.

#### ~~Interface route on-link flag — no VyOS equivalent~~ (by design)

`route.on-link` suppresses next-hop reachability checks in netplan. VyOS has
no equivalent knob — all static routes are installed regardless of next-hop
reachability. The flag is silently ignored; no warning is emitted because the
VyOS behaviour already matches the intent.

#### ~~`spec.revision` not forwarded to VyOS~~ (by design)

`NodeNetworkConfig.spec.revision` is a Kubernetes-side revision tag with no
VyOS CLI equivalent. It is tracked for reconcile visibility and surfaced as an
informational warning. Emitting it as a VyOS config node would require an
opaque description string with no operational value on the routing target.
Design decision: revision tracking stays on the Kubernetes side only.

---

### 2 — BGP delete consolidation regex (low / high priority)

#### BGP delete consolidation regex misses quoted special characters

The regex `r"^set (vrf name '[^']+' protocols bgp neighbor '[^']+')(?:\s|$)"`
does not handle VRF names or neighbor addresses that contain an escaped single
quote. Such commands are not consolidated and instead generate individual leaf
deletes, which may leave VyOS with a partially configured neighbor after commit.

---

### ~~3 — Rollback on apply failure~~ ✓

When `configure_commands` returns `success: false`, `reconcile_documents` now
calls `client.discard_pending()` immediately to clear any staged-but-uncommitted
VyOS state. Applied state is not updated on failure. The next apply attempt
therefore starts from a clean configuration baseline.

`ReconcileRunResult` exposes `rollback_performed` and `rollback_response` for
observability.

---

### ~~4 — BGP route-map / import-export filter compilation~~ ✓

Structured `importFilter` / `exportFilter` objects from the CRD are now compiled
into VyOS policy objects:

- `set policy route-map '<name>' rule '<N>' action 'permit|deny'` per filter item
- `set policy prefix-list|prefix-list6 '<name>'` with optional `ge`/`le` for prefix matchers
- `set policy community-list '<name>'` with optional `exact-match` for community matchers
- Route modification: `set community`, `set community additive`, `set community 'none'`,
  `set comm-list delete`
- Default action rule (65535) per route-map
- Binding: `route-map import|export '<name>'` on BGP neighbor address-family

Simple string references (`routeMap`, `prefixList`, `distributionList`) remain unsupported.

---

### ~~5 — Cluster-scoped CRD watch~~ ✓

The controller and status writer both support `--cluster-scoped-source` and
`--cluster-scoped-status`. URL construction in `KubeDocumentClient._resource_url()`
and `KubeStatusWriter._patch_plan()` omit the `/namespaces/{ns}` segment when
the flag is set. The `cluster_scoped_status` parameter is forwarded end-to-end
from `run_controller` to the status writer on every iteration.

---

### ~~6 — Full CRA status contract~~ ✓

Three CRA-level readiness conditions are now emitted per document alongside the
existing DesiredSeen / Applied / InSync conditions:

- `Reconciling` — `True` when phase is `PendingApply` or `Drifted`
- `Degraded` — `True` when phase is `Error` (carries the last error message)
- `Available` — `True` when phase is `InSync`

Per-interface readiness is deferred: it requires the adapter to correlate
desired interface config with VyOS operational state, which has no stable
upstream API yet.

---

### ~~7 — Leader election~~ ✓

Kubernetes Lease-based leader election using `coordination.k8s.io/v1` Lease API.

- `KubeLeaseManager`: acquires/renews a Lease object per namespace; non-leaders
  skip VyOS apply but still reconcile locally (plan mode)
- `NoopLeaseManager`: always-leader default when `--enable-leader-election` is not set
- CLI flags: `--enable-leader-election`, `--leader-id`, `--lease-namespace`,
  `--lease-duration-seconds`
- `run_controller()` checks `lease_manager.acquire()` before each cycle; on
  loss of leadership, apply is suppressed but state tracking continues

---

### ~~8 — Real informer loop~~ ✓

`KubernetesDocumentSource` now uses a background watch thread (informer pattern):

- Background `_watch_loop()` thread runs continuous list-then-watch with
  exponential backoff (0.2s → 30s) and periodic full resync (default 30min)
- Events pushed to a bounded `queue.Queue(maxsize=256)`; `wait_for_update()`
  consumes from the queue, waking immediately when a change arrives
- Thread-safe cache with `threading.Lock` around document/resourceVersion state
- Automatic relist on watch errors (410/stale), full resync on queue overflow
- `stop()` method for clean shutdown

---

### ~~9 — L2 / VNI — VXLAN + EVPN~~ ✓

Layer2 domains and EVPN fabric VRF configuration are now translated:

- **Layer2** (`spec.layer2s`): VXLAN interface (`vni`, `mtu`, `nolearning`), bridge
  domain (`br<VLAN>`), VXLAN-to-bridge binding, IRB (IP addresses, MAC, VRF attachment)
- **EVPN on fabricVRFs**: VNI-to-VRF binding, l2vpn-evpn address-family activation,
  `advertise-all-vni`, route targets (export/import), EVPN export filter compiled
  into route-map, VRF imports with per-import filter
- **l2vpn-evpn** recognized as a BGP address family for peer activation
- New models: `Layer2Spec`, `Layer2Irb`, `MirrorAcl`, `VrfImport`; `VrfSpec` extended
  with `vni`, `evpn_export_route_targets`, `evpn_import_route_targets`,
  `evpn_export_filter`, `vrf_imports`

Limitations documented in MAPPING.md: VTEP source-address not in CRD (VyOS uses
loopback), Route Distinguisher auto-generated, mirrorAcls surfaced as unsupported.

---

### Completed translation gaps — NodeNetworkConfig

#### ~~Policy route: direct next-hop action not emitted~~ ✓

`policyRoute.nextHop.address` is now emitted as
`set policy route '<name>' rule '<id>' set nexthop '<address>'`.
Address takes priority over `vrf` and `table` targets.
Address-family mismatch produces a warning and skips the nexthop command.

#### ~~Policy route: only the first protocol is used~~ ✓

`_translate_policy_route()` now iterates over all supported protocols and emits
one VyOS rule per protocol (incrementing rule_id). Unsupported protocols are
skipped; if all are unsupported the rule is omitted with a warning.

#### ~~Policy route: only the first port is used~~ ✓

`sourcePorts` and `destinationPorts` are now joined with commas and emitted as
a single VyOS port value, which VyOS natively accepts as a comma-separated list.

#### ~~Static route: next-hop interface not mapped~~ ✓

`NextHop.interface` is parsed and emitted as
`set ... static route '<prefix>' interface '<iface>'`.

#### ~~BGP: peer password not mapped~~ ✓

Parsed into `BgpPeer.password` and emitted as `set ... neighbor '<addr>' password '<value>'`.

#### ~~BGP: timers not mapped~~ ✓

`keepalive` and `holdtime` emitted as `set ... timers keepalive` / `set ... timers holdtime`.
Both must be present together (VyOS requirement); missing one produces a warning.

#### ~~BGP: BFD and graceful-restart not mapped~~ ✓

Emitted as `set ... bfd` / `set ... graceful-restart` leaf nodes.

#### ~~BGP: global router-id not mapped~~ ✓

Emitted as `set vrf name '<n>' protocols bgp parameters router-id '<id>'`.

---

### Completed translation gaps — NodeNetplanConfig

#### ~~Interface family assumed to be ethernet~~ ✓

`_netplan_interface_path()` now calls `_infer_interface_type()` for both base
and VLAN sub-interfaces. Falls back to `ethernet` only when prefix is unrecognised.

#### ~~Interface MTU not mapped~~ ✓

Emitted as `set interfaces <family> <name> mtu '<value>'`.

#### ~~Interface route metric not mapped~~ ✓

Appended as `distance '<metric>'` to the static route next-hop command.

#### ~~DHCP / dynamic address not mapped~~ ✓

Emitted as `set interfaces <family> <name> address 'dhcp'` / `'dhcp6'`.

#### ~~NodeNetplanConfig.spec.desiredState (netplan native format)~~ ✓

Dual-format parsing: `spec.desiredState.network.{ethernets,bonds,...}` (upstream
netplan.State, wrapped and unwrapped) and legacy `spec.interfaces` / `spec.ethernets`.

---

### Completed convergence gaps

#### ~~No delete emitted for policy route interface binding on document change~~ ✓

#### ~~Scalar leaf delete includes value — VyOS rejects path~~ ✓

#### ~~No delete emitted for VRF table change~~ ✓

---

## Current Limitations

The following are known limitations of the current implementation. They are
documented here for visibility and may be addressed in a future iteration.

### Translation limitations

- **mirrorAcls** — `layer2s.<name>.mirrorAcls` are detected and surfaced as
  unsupported. GRE traffic mirroring is VyOS-version-dependent and not yet
  mapped to VyOS commands.

- **Simple string route-map references** — `routeMap`, `prefixList`,
  `distributionList` fields on BGP peers are recognised but not compiled into
  VyOS policy objects. Only the structured `importFilter`/`exportFilter` CRD
  objects are compiled. String references remain marked as unsupported.

- **VTEP source-address** — the VXLAN tunnel source IP is not present in the
  upstream CRD. VyOS uses the loopback or default route as source. For explicit
  control in multi-node EVPN fabrics, a future `--vtep-source-address` CLI
  parameter could be added (per-node property, not per-document).

- **Route Distinguisher** — absent from the CRD. VyOS auto-generates the RD
  as `<router-id>:<vni>`. No manual override is possible through the adapter.

- **Per-interface readiness** — the CRA status conditions report document-level
  readiness (Available, Reconciling, Degraded) but not per-interface state.
  Correlating desired interface config with VyOS operational state would require
  reading back from the VyOS API, which has no stable upstream contract yet.

### API versioning limitations

- The list of known API groups (`network.t-caas.telekom.com`, `sylva.io`) is
  hardcoded. The adapter does not call the Kubernetes API discovery endpoint
  (`/apis`). A new upstream API group requires adding one line to
  `KNOWN_API_VARIANTS` in `k8s_resources.py`.

- CRD schema validation is not performed by the adapter. It parses what it
  understands and surfaces the rest as warnings or unsupported markers.

- Local CRD files in `k8s/crds/` are pinned to `network.t-caas.telekom.com`.
  The drift check script (`scripts/check-sylva-drift.py`) compares against
  upstream `sylva-elements/network-connector@main`.

---

## Next Steps

Potential future work, not yet scheduled. Ordered by operational value.

### Live validation on VyOS lab

Run the adapter against the real VyOS VM with the full
command set including EVPN/VXLAN. Validate that generated commands are
accepted and produce the expected configuration.

### CI/CD — GitHub Actions

Automate the 3 test suites (boundary, chaos, fuzz) on every PR. The
required status checks are already defined in branch protection but not
yet wired to a workflow.

### Upstream API tracking

Monitor `sylva-elements/network-connector@main` for API group renaming
(merge into sylva-core is in progress). Update `KNOWN_API_VARIANTS` and
local CRDs when the upstream stabilises.

### Container packaging

Build a container image and Helm chart for deploying the adapter as a
Kubernetes pod. Prerequisite for leader election to be useful in
production.

### Observability — Prometheus metrics

Expose counters (commands generated, apply successes/failures, reconcile
latency, watch events) as Prometheus metrics. Useful for alerting in a
production deployment.
